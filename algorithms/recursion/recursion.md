# Recursion

**3 Parts of a recursive function to avoid stack overflow**

1. Identify the base case

2. Identify the recursive case

3. Get closer and close and return when neede. usually you have 2 return
   one for the base case and the other for the recursive case

**Anything you do with recursion CAN also be done iteratively(loops)**

**When to use Recursion**
Better when it comes to traversal, or searching through trees or graphs. Recursion is better than
an iterative approach. It is also preferred in some sorting algorithms.

Every time you are using a tree or converting somethign int oa treee, consider recursion.

1. Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. Each instance of the subproblem is identiacal in nature.
3. The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problems

Divide and Conquer using recursion

Recursion is GOOD AT:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Tree Traversal
- Graph Traversal
